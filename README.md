# Login-and-Registration-using-Google-Firebase
This is a simple HTML CSS JS Website with Google Firebase Authentication. 

To view the website, please open Login.html using Chrome Browser (or similar) afterwhich you can navigate using the Signup Instead? Button to go through email registration page.

Please note that this website uses Google SignOn and Facebook Login which requires it to be executed on a Local Server. I personally have used XamppServer.
